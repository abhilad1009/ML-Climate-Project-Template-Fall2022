With the latest remote sensing technologies and abundance of data, modern machine
learning-based methods have made it possible to accurately predict weather events which
is crucial in todayâ€™s scenario of climate change. The Weather4cast NeurIPS Competition
ventures to predict future rainfall patterns with modern machine learning algorithms. Using
large-scale satellite radiance measurements over a large area, the goal is to predict highresolution
local rainfall events up to 8 hours into the future as measured by ground-radar
weather stations. We explore the domain knowledge to identify areas of concern from a
machine-learning perspective. Instead of proposing new model architecture, we exploit
domain knowledge to tweak the existing 3D UNet model architecture with relevant layers
which are better suited for the proposed task. We hope to provide a brief glimpse into how
domain-specific approaches can be helpful for resource-constrained environments.
