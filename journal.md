# 18-25 September
## Project Selection
* Selected Project topic: Weather4cast - Super-Resolution Rain Movie Prediction under Spatio-temporal Shifts
* Link: [https://www.iarai.ac.at/weather4cast/](https://www.iarai.ac.at/weather4cast/)
* Part of NeurIPS 2022 competitions
* Working on cloning the starter code and figuring out data formats

# 25 September - 1 October
## Literature Review
* https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169809521003306
* https://deepstruct.github.io/ICML17/1stDeepStructWS_paper_2.pdf
## Implementation Resource
* https://monai.io/

# 2 September - 30 October
## Base Code Review
* Completed review of starter code
* Identified implemetation changes
* To Do: Customize Deep Learning Model
## Data Collection (Bulk of time spent here)
* Downloaded training and validation dataset (>300 GB)
* Setup storage with Google cloud subscription
* Setup coding environment with Colab subscription
## Data Analysis
* Priliminary analysis of data from notebooks in starter code
* To Do: Perform data augmentation based on domain knowlede
* To Do: Convert data augmentation techniques to be compatible with the training code

# 1 November - 10 November
## Dataset usage
* Complete stage 2 dataset size is a limiting factor
* Due to computing resource limitations, we will restrict our model development to stage 1 which includes a subset of the complete dataset.

## Environment setup
* Baseline model creation is complete
* To Do: Resolve depedancy issues
* To Do: Train baseline model on stage 1 data

# 15 November - 20 November
## Model training
* Generate prediction from trained baseline model
* Add custom deep learning model based on state-of-the-art approaches
